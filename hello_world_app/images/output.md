**`hello_world_app/`**: This is the main directory of the Flask application.

- **`__init__.py`**: This file is used to initialize the Python package. It can also contain application setup code, such as creating the Flask app instance and configuring it.
  
- **`auth.py`**: This module handles authentication-related routes. It typically includes functions for user signup, login, and logout.
  
- **`main.py`**: This file often serves as the entry point for your application. It might include the main application logic and route definitions.
  
- **`venv/`**: This is a virtual environment directory that contains the dependencies of this project. It isolates the projectâ€™s packages from the global Python environment.
  
- **`__pycache__/`**: This directory stores the compiled bytecode of your Python files. It is automatically created by Python and can be ignored in most cases.

## Key Files in `auth.py`

- **`signup()`**: This function is meant to handle user registration.

- **`login()`**: This function manages user login requests.

- **`logout()`**: This function handles user logout requests.

### Additional Notes

- **Routing**: The `@auth.route()` decorator is used to define the URL endpoints for each function, making it easy to manage different parts of your application.

- **Terminal Output**: The terminal shows logs of requests made to your application, including status codes (like `200` for success and `404` for not found).
